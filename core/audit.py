"""Activity log / chain-of-custody trail (NFR2).

Every action the tool performs against a host is recorded here with a
timestamp. Records are (a) appended to a CSV file so results survive the run
and can be pasted into Chapter 4 / an appendix, and (b) pushed to any
registered observer so the GUI log panel updates live.

Credentials/secrets must NEVER be passed to log().
